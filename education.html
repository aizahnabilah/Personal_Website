<br><li><b>Preschool: Pasti Al-Kauthar</b>
<br> - Pusat Asuhan Tunas Islam (PASTI) is an early childhood education institution in Malaysia, established by the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). It focuses on providing Islamic-based education to young children, typically aged 4 to 6. At age of 4, I've already being one of the PASTI students. For the three years I attended PASTI, I always got in the top three among other PASTI students. I was also awarded a cleanliness award when I was six years old. What's interesting is that all my siblings go to the same PASTI as me.</br>
<br><li><b>Primary School: SK Maras </b>
<br> - After graduated from PASTI Al-Kauthar, I choose SK Maras as my primary school. Here, I was still an excellent student and always got the top three numbers on every test. Thanks to my achievements, I became one of the candidates who will receive straight As in UPSR. But unfortunately, I only managed to achieve the results of 4A1B, where B is a mathematics subject, because I am quite weak in mathematics.</br>
<br><li><b>Secondary School: SMK Tengku Mizan Zainal Abidin</b>
<br> - Because I failed to get a place at SMA Khairiah, I ended up going to school here. I managed to get a 7A result in PT3 and chose a pure science stream class where the elective subjects consisted of Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Additional Mathematic. Unfortunately, I'm quite weak in the subject of Additional Mathematic, causing me to only get an average SPM result, making me no longer a smart student like before.</br>
<br><li><b>Secondary School: SMK Kompleks Mengabang Telipot</b>
<br> - I chose to continue my education by entering STPM instead of diploma. And in this school, I spent my STPM years happily even though I was a little stressed with assignments and end-of-semester exams. at first it was quite difficult for me to adapt to the atmosphere of STPM, but thank goodness, I returned to being an excellent student in STPM after being disappointed with the results of the previous SPM. My friend and I succeeded in fulfilling our dream of going up on stage as excellent STPM students.</br>
<br><li><b>University: Universiti Teknologi Mara Kedah Branch</b>
<br> - after getting excellent results in STPM, I was offered to continue studying at UITM Kedah for a bachelor's degree. I am very grateful for being given the opportunity to study in the major that I dream of. Through this major, I was able to learn and know that library management is not only about arranging books in the library. I also learned how to do basic coding and build a basic website which is something new for me.</br>
