<p><b><center><h1 style="background-color:SkyBlue;">The Origin of Aizah Nabilah</b></center> 
<br><li><b>Name: Nur Aizah Nabilah Binti Marzuki</b>
<br> - Surprisingly, my name was supposedly Nur Aina, but my mother decided to visit her friend who just gave birth, which caused her to change her mind and name me Nur Aizah instead of Nur Aina. The reason behind this because the daughter of my mother's friend is also Aina, and my mother thinks that one day both of us will be in the same class. It turned out that my mother was right. We were classmates from primary school and secondary school. Is my mother a fortune teller? Kindly ask my mother.</br>
<br><li><b>Birthdate: 25 December 2003 (25/12/2003)</b>
<br> - Another fact about me! The doctor predicted that the due date for my mother to give birth to me was January 6, 2004. But my mother ended up giving birth to me on December 25, 2003. What is special about December 25 is that it is also my mother's birthdate. Basically, I am the gift for my mother. Because of that, my mom thinks I'm the younger version of her. We share the same traits: being stubborn and easily sulking. Blame my mom! And to my mom, please love me more than other siblings since we share the same birthdate!</br>
<br><li><b>Height: 147cm</b>
<br> - It is quite shameful to be 147 cm in 20s. But dont blame me, its all from the genetics of my parents (both of them are short too, please dont tell them!). Also, I'm the biggest hater of milk, When I was a kid, my sister and I made a glass of milk and only drank one sip before we proceeded to throw it out the window of the house. So, me and my sister need to bear the consequences of being short forever. At least I look younger than my age. Win-win situation.</br>
<br><li><b>Weight: 47kg</b>
<br> - This is my current weight (I wish I was under 45kg). My BMI is normal, but I cannot be comfortable with that information. I need to get skinny and weigh 40 kg for an ideal body. Wish me luck on the journey of my diet. Tomorrow, day one!</br>
<br><li><b>Favourite color: Blue and Pink</b>
<br> - At first, I liked pink, and if possible, all the items I own must be pink, or I would rather not have those items. But when I grew up, I started to change my mind and started liking the color blue (still like pink but not as fanatically as before). And people around me keep saying that blue is pretty on me. So yeah, I'm officially a blue lover! To be honest, I like blue because of my celebrity crush. Because of him, I forced myself to like blue, and it turns out that blue is my color. Thanks to my celebrity crush for being the reason I realized how beautiful blue is.</br>
<br><li><b>Hobbies: Reading and Writing</b>
<br> -I love reading so much! And a unique fact about me is that I spent my childhood with books instead of playing outside, playing with dolls, and more. And for writing—don't be surprised—I started to create stories when I was ten years old. That was the moment that I discovered my talent for writing. And I even published my own story on Wattpad, and guess what? The story reached 2,000 readers, which is a lot for me. Wanna know a sneak peek at that story? It was based on my own experiences having a crush on my junior and the journey of me trying to be his friend, and I did it! For now, we stayed as friends, and don't worry, I've already moved on from him since he's already someone else's boyfriend. </br>
<br><li><b>Ambition: Librarian, Author</b>
<br> - When I was a kid, I wanted to be a writer or author since that is my one and only talent. And I even applied for a Bachelor of Writing (Honors) in Creative Writing, but I got a Bachelor of Information Science (Honors) in Library Management instead. But I wasn't disappointed, since being a librarian is also one of my plans. I love being with books, and I'm sure that being a librarian is the perfect career for me. And for writing, being a librarian doesn't stop me from writing and being a writer. and I hope that one day my story can be published as a physical book. Wish me luck!</br>
<br><li><b>Education: SK Maras, SMK Tengku Mizan Zainal Abidin and SMK Kompleks Mengabang Telipot</b>
<br> - I went to primary school in SK Maras and obtained a 4A1B result in Primary School Achievement Test (UPSR), and I chose SMK Tengku Mizan Zainal Abidin as a secondary school due to its close proximity to where I live. As for STPM, I continued my studies at SMK Kompleks Mengabang Telipot and managed to become one of the students who got a flying-color result in the Malaysian Higher School Certificate (STPM).</br>
<br><li><b>Job Experience: Retail Associate of MR.DIY</b>
<br> - After I finished my studies for STPM, I applied for a job at Mr. DIY while waiting for the university admission results. And whats shocking is, Mr. DIY in my hometown lacks an employee, and I was asked to be an employee immediately. It was the most beautiful and challenging experience for me because it was my first time working and getting paid. However, after three months of working, I finally resigned as I had successfully obtained the university admission result at UiTM Cawangan Kedah.</br>
